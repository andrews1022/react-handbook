# React Handbook

A while ago I created the [JavaScript Handbook](https://github.com/andrews1022/javascript-handbook) repo. It contains notes, examples, and sample projects all around Vanilla JavaScript. Now I am doing the same for React!

I'm starting off small, but I will be adding to and expanding this project overtime. I will most likely not be adding projects here, as React projects can be quite large. So I'll most likely be putting them in their own repo.
