# Hooks

If you're looking for notes on a particular hook, see the other files in this folder

Some rules to using Hooks:

- You can ONLY use hooks inside functional components. You CANNOT use them in class componets
- Hooks MUST be called in the EXACT SAME order in every component render. This means you cannot put them inside if statements, functions, loops, etc. They CANNOT be nested inside of anything
