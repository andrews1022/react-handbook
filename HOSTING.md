# Hosting a React Project

We can use GitHub and Netlify to easily host our React projects, for FREE! :O

- Once finished working on your project, it's time to create a production ready build. To do so, run:
  `yarn build` or `npm run build`

- Go to Netlify, click on New site from Git
- Choose your Git Provider
- Choose your repo, make sure to choose /build
